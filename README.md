# plutus-unlift
This library implements the mechanism for recovering Haskell datatypes from Plutus DataScripts described in [https://github.com/javcasas/plutus-pubsub-paper/blob/master/paper.pdf](https://github.com/javcasas/plutus-pubsub-paper/blob/master/paper.pdf).

## Usage
The library can be imported into your own project, but you may have to update the version of Plutus being used.

## Testsuite
Just run `stack test`.
